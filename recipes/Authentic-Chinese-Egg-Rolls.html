        <h2>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>3 leaves napa cabbage, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package round gyoza/potsticker wrappers</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the filling: Place shrimp in a food processor, 
                and process until shrimp are finely ground; 
                transfer into a large bowl and set aside. 
                Working in batches, process ground beef until 
                fine, add to ground shrimp. Add ginger, shallot, 
                green onions, napa cabbage, soy sauce, sesame 
                oil, salt, white pepper, and white sugar to shrimp 
                and beef mixture; mix thoroughly until well combined.</li>
            <li>To fill the potstickers: Place a wrapper on the work 
                surface and add a scant teaspoon of filling in the 
                center. With a wet finger, dampen the edges of the 
                wrapper. Fold dough into a half-moon shape, enclosing 
                the filling, and press and seal to remove extra air and 
                tightly seal the edges together. It's nice to fold 
                several small pleats in the top half of the wrapper 
                for a traditional look before you seal in the filling. 
                Refrigerate the filled wrappers on a parchment-lined 
                baking sheet while you finish filling and sealing 
                the potstickers.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet with a lid over 
                medium heat. Place potstickers into hot oil, 
                flat-side down, without crowding, and let fry until 
                the bottoms are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn 
                dumplings over, and pour water over them. Cover the 
                pan with a lid and let dumplings steam until water 
                has nearly evaporated and dumplings have begun to 
                fry in oil again, 5 to 7 minutes. Uncover the skillet, 
                and let potstickers cook until all the water is 
                evaporated and the wrapper has shrunk down tightly 
                onto the filling, another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
